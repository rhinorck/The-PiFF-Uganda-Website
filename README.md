The Pay it Forward Foundation Uganda (PiFF Uganda) is a non-governmental organisation whose vision is to build a better world by spreading the idea of kindness.

We believe every individual has the ability to make their world better by practising kindness in their everyday lives.

'Paying it forward' is the act of increasing the goodwill in the world you live in by choosing to put into it the goodwill that you know and possess; it is the belief that what we hold to be of value counts for more when shared with the world around us.

Kindness is a generosity of spirit that nourishes both body and mind and fills one's cup of life. It is an internal culture which begins with being kind to oneself.
